#🖼️ Build-an-Image-Slider 

A simple image slider built with Python using Tkinter and PIL.  
Automatically cycles through images in a folder with navigation controls.  
Great for learning GUI basics and image handling in Python.  
Make sure to place your images inside an `images/` folder before running.
